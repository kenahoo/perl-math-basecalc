Revision history for Perl extension Math::BaseCalc.

1.15 - Tue May 10 23:34:09 CDT 2011

 - Fixed a problem converting very-large numbers (near the integer
   limits of Perl's native types). [Spotted by Jacob Bunk Nielsen]

1.14 - Sat Feb 26 21:06:25 CST 2011

 - Added the ability to use a dash as a valid digit, which turns off
   recognition of negative numbers. [Nicolas]

 - Fixed typo in docs. [Takayuki Kawakami]

 - Updated distribution to use Dist::Zilla.

1.13 - Sat Jan 17 17:23:22 2009

 - Fixed a test failure that occurred on some subset of 64-bit
   machines. [Brian Szymanski, Andreas J. König]

 - Moved the repository to SVN hosting at code.google.com instead of
   CVS on my laptop.

1.12 - Thu Jun 26 16:01:32 2008

 - Modernized the layout of the distribution, including a lib/
   directory, t/ directory, and using Test::More instead of rolling my
   own TAP function.  [Todd E. Rinaldo]

1.011  Sat Mar 09 22:46:07 2002

 - Fixed a warning & a couple of tiny doc errors

1.009  Thu Mar 29 21:28:57 EST 2001

 - Now supports non-integers.  Thanks to jdimov@cis.clarion.edu for
   idea (though I used a different implementation)

 - Handles large numbers (bigger than 2^32, or type 'int').

1.008  2000/08/28 14:56:09
